# Verification record

Full verification results for the `examples/` apps in this repo, run against the
published `@adasp/latency-test` package. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full pass
criteria and process this record follows.

This file is the verification record for **Tier 1 (`examples/`) only**. All findings
below were filed against the component repo as
[idsinge/latency-test#30](https://github.com/idsinge/latency-test/issues/30) (Phase 6
findings), closed 2026-06-17. Tier 2 (`demos/`) work was unblocked once that issue
closed — Tier 2 status and findings live in README.md's roadmap table and each
demo's own `NOTES.md`, not in this document.

## Environment

- Package version: `@adasp/latency-test@1.2.0`
- Browser: Firefox 151.0.4 (aarch64)
- OS: macOS 15.4 (24E248)
- Audio: beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO 80Ω headphones + built-in mic

## Pass criteria

An app passes when: the custom element upgrades (the component is headless — nothing
visible renders); the five-event success sequence fires in order with no
`latency-error`; the negative-path check confirms `latency-error` wiring; registry
consumption is verified (fresh `npm ci`, lockfile resolves to registry.npmjs.org, no
`file:`/`link:` refs); the browser console is clean in dev and production builds; and
a run yields a reliable result (`ratio > 18 dB`). The `<h1>` framework heading in each
app is an intentional UX-only deviation from docs-mirror fidelity.

All apps additionally passed: custom element upgrade, five-event success sequence,
negative-path check, and registry consumption — see Pass criteria above.

## Findings

### Vanilla JS

- Docs findings (component repo, not fixed there): CDN snippet originally missing
  `<title>` (fixed in this repo's `cdn.html`, commit `9f97019` — the component-docs
  page itself still carries the omission); no SRI on the CDN script tag; pre-upgrade
  race in the inline script.

### React

- StrictMode double-mount logs the upgrade check twice in dev — expected, not a finding.

### Vue

- `isCustomElement` required in `vite.config.js` (documented on the docs page).

### Svelte

- Docs Svelte 4 syntax (`on:click`, bare `let`) works verbatim in Svelte 5 — legacy
  mode auto-detected, no `runes={false}` needed.
- **Docs finding:** `<latency-test ... />` self-closing tag triggers a Svelte build
  warning — docs should use `<latency-test ...></latency-test>`.

### Angular

- Angular 22 is fully zoneless by default — `zone.js` must be installed manually and
  `provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true })` added to `app.config.ts`.
- `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` required after `await getUserMedia()` and
  CustomEvent callbacks — zone.js alone does not trigger CD in these cases.
- **Docs finding:** docs page needs a note for Angular 22+ scaffolds.
- Prod-build local preview requires serving `dist/angular/browser` under the
  `/latency-test-examples/angular/` path prefix (`baseHref`):
  ```
  mkdir -p /tmp/ng-preview/latency-test-examples/angular
  cp -r dist/angular/browser/* /tmp/ng-preview/latency-test-examples/angular/
  npx serve -l 3000 /tmp/ng-preview
  ```
  Open `http://localhost:3000/latency-test-examples/angular/`.

### Next.js

- SSR guard: `'use client'` + lazy `import('@adasp/latency-test')` inside `useEffect`.
- `basePath` applies in dev too — open `http://localhost:3000/latency-test-examples/nextjs/`.
- Prod preview requires the same `/tmp` baseHref-style workaround as Angular:
  ```
  mkdir -p /tmp/nextjs-preview/latency-test-examples/nextjs
  cp -r out/* /tmp/nextjs-preview/latency-test-examples/nextjs/
  npx serve -l 3000 /tmp/nextjs-preview
  ```
- **Docs finding:** docs claims React 19+ auto-bridges `HTMLElementTagNameMap` to JSX
  — false in Next.js 16 + `@types/react` 19.2.17. Manual declaration required:
  `declare module 'react' { namespace JSX { ... } }`, not `declare namespace JSX`
  (targets the wrong namespace in React 19).
- **Docs bugs (noted, not patched):** `connect()` does not reset error state on retry;
  does not close `AudioContext` in the catch block.
